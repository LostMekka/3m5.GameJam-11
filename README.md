# WINDOWS DEFENDER
The game. Also runs on Mac. (probably)

This is a clicker RPG with crafting elements, built with Compose for Desktop.
It is our cursed entry for the 3m5.GameJam#11 event.

## How to play
You control the player window by moving it around the screen.
Enemy windows will spawn and try to bit the player window. You have to defend it!!

Scan for resource deposits, then move your player window to them (or them to it) to start revealing what is inside the deposit. Once revealed, loot the resources inside before the deposit collapses!

Attack the enemy windows by clicking on them. or trying to close them. They drop loot too!

Use your hard earned loot to unlock new crafting stations and upgrades.
Remember that almost everything in the game can only be interacted with, if the player window is near it!

Travel to new areas by activating travel selection mode and dragging the selection window onto the target area you want to visit.
Each area has different resource deposits and enemies.
There are even some buildings that can only be built inside specific areas.

## How to win
You don't.

There is no way to win right now. The game is open ended for now.
Maybe we can add a win condition if we decide to work on the game a bit more.
